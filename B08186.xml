            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:185203:4"/>
            <p>One eſpeciall meanes effectually tending hereunto, is to be acquainted with the paſſages of Gods providence abroad, and to make ſuch uſe of his dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he himſelfe in Scripture directs us to. For our information in the ſtate of things abroad, theſe enſuing ſchedules may helpe ſuch as have no better intelligence. Wherein ſuch paſſages are related <hi>as may make both our eares tingle to heare them.</hi> The heads inſiſted on are <hi>the Arrowes of the Almighty;</hi> Sword, Famine, and Peſtilence, together with their pale and griſly attendants. Extortion, Rapine, ſalvage cruelty, deſolations, deaths of all kinde. A ſad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall troope.</p>
            <p>The ſubject on which all theſe evils light, is <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> a neighbouring countrey well knowne. The Throne of Europes Empire. This is now the Stage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt direfull Tragedies are acted. And therein as well the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (the more the pity) as the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> no difference for religions ſake; nor any reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ages, ſexes or conditions. <hi>The Fowles of the ayre may therein eate the fleſh of Kings, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and mighty men. The fleſh of horſes, and them that ſit on them. Yea the fleſh of all men both free and bond, both ſmall and great.</hi> Rev. <hi>19.18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inſtances and particulars which are here recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are ſuch as may ſeem incredible, and cauſe wondring unto aſtoniſhment, yet is there nothing but what may well be counted probable, a few things conſidered. As firſt, what God threatens in this kinde for breach of his Law.
<pb facs="tcp:185203:4"/> Deut. <hi>28.53,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt eate the fruite or thine owne body, the fleſh of thy ſonnes and daughters —. The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eyes ſhall be evill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his brother, and toward the wife of his boſome, and towards the remnant of children which he ſhall leave: ſo that he will not give to any of them the fleſh of his children, whom he ſhall eate, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then what particular inſtances we have of like things upon like occaſions in Scripture, as in the ſiege of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, 2 King. 6.28, 29.</hi> The certainety of the generals is beyond all exception, among thoſe that will believe any thing more than they ſee with their eyes, and feele with their hands. The time, and ſpace that the wars have endured addes much to the probability of all ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects avoucht. The current yeere making up full twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſince the beginning. During all which <hi>Germany</hi> hath beene <hi>Acheldama, a field of blood.</hi> Vnder this word <hi>(warre)</hi> more evill and miſchiefe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended than can be uttered. Weigh all things duly, the ſeverall kinds of warre, forraigne and domeſticke; by invaſions, by inſurrections, the ſame perſons, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being to day Conquerours, and to morrow conquered, over and over againe, and all things every day worſe and worſe; we may well conclude, <hi>the one halfe hath not beene told us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope none among us are ſo prophane as to ſay what is this to us, bee it all bee true? and few ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as not to know what God requireth of us
<pb facs="tcp:185203:5"/> in this regard. Yet it's too manifeſt, that moſt are ſo careleſſe, that they neede a Monitor to twit them by the eare. I have therefore partly upon intreatie, and chiefly for affection unto the thing it ſelfe, endevoured briefly to ſpeake ſomething unto that end. <hi>The Lyon hath roared, who will not feare? The Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, who can but prophecie,</hi> Amos <hi>3.8. Salvian</hi> in his time, tooke great paines to prove there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, when the then ſuppoſed barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> broke in upon the Empire, as the Sea doth ſometimes over-flow the bankes. But mee thinkes that alone was enough to manifeſt <hi>the finger of God,</hi> which bred the doubt in men Atheiſticall. How exceeding full is the Scripture for the proofe of this? <hi>That God is Authour of all Judgements, and therefore in all wee ought to looke up unto him.</hi> All Captaines and their armies are but Sergeants under <hi>the Lord of hoſts; that man of warre, and God of battell. The Aſſyrian is the rod of Gods anger, the ſtaffe in their hand is Gods indignation,</hi> Iſay <hi>10.5. There is no evill in a City but he doth it. Behold</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>what deſolations the Lord hath made in the earth,</hi> Pſal. <hi>46.8.</hi> If a Sparrow fall not to the ground, but <hi>according to the will of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father,</hi> much leſſe are millions of men mowed downe with the ſword, but according to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Iudgement.</p>
            <p>It is alſo cleare out of Scripture, that wee ought to lay to heart thoſe Iudgemements of God, which wee are acquainted with, and eſpecially his greater Iudgements.
<pb facs="tcp:185203:5"/> God ſends one place to conſider of another: <hi>Goe yee now unto my place, which was in</hi> Shilo, <hi>where I ſet my name at the beginning, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſſe of my people Iſrael,</hi> Ier. <hi>7.12.</hi> ſaith God to the men of Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>And who makes queſtion, but that thoſe <hi>Churches, Nations, Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> which have ſpeciall relation one unto another, ſacred or civill, in the bonds of Religion, neighbourhood or commerce, are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bound mutually to conſider and bemoane one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conditions.</p>
            <p>This likewiſe is evident, that our Church and State, and every member of the ſame, ought upon ſpeciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to be cordially affected with the miſeries of <hi>Germany.</hi> They are of the ſame Religion with us, Chriſtians as wee are; our peace is the weaker for want of theirs; many of our owne have ſuffered with them. But above all is the affliction of that <hi>Royall Lady,</hi> our Gracious Soveraignes onely ſiſter, who hath ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in her Royall Perſon, and may ſuffer yet more in her poſterity, but God forbid. But what is it that wee muſt doe, or learne from the ſtate of things in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> The particulars are ſeverall, in ſeverall regards. In relation to God, to them, and to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>In regard of God. Wee muſt acknowledge the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Wiſdome, and unſearchableneſſe of his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take heede of raſh aſsigning the cauſe. Some lay all the blame upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as if their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among themſelves, and unneceſſary ſeparation (in their phraſe) from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> were the
<pb facs="tcp:185203:6"/> roote of all. But is it not more likely, that <hi>Germany drinkes now of the cup of wrath, becauſe ſhee hath long drunke of the cup of ſundry great abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations?</hi> The generall cauſe, which is ſinne, wee all acknowledge: It were a happineſſe to know the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, according unto that, <hi>Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas.</hi> But ſuch a ſpirit of diſcerning God gives not unto all. They themſelves beſt know their owne waies, caſe and ſtate, and therefore wee may leave it unto them to conſider of the ſpeciall cauſes, whom it moſt concernes. <hi>But who will not feare the Lord, and glorifie his Name, who onely is holy, and whoſe judgements are made manifeſt,</hi> Rev. <hi>15.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect of them, firſt let us ſympathize: grieve with them that grieve. Rom. <hi>12.15. and weepe with them that weepe.</hi> We are all members of one and the ſame myſticall body, whereof Chriſt is head. Our peace and ſecurity is in a great meaſure bound up in theirs: their troubles may increaſe ours; as they have already occaſioned many feares, cares and expences: Witneſſe the great levie of ſouldiers at ſome times, and not a little chargeable Embaſſages from our King and State. Next of all, we are to pray for them, that God would reſtore peace, and make up all breaches. <hi>Giving the Lord no reſt, untill hee make</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>the praiſe of the earth. Abraham</hi> interceded long for <hi>Sodome,</hi> how much more ought we to do the like for them? And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we have ability and opportunity, we ought to help and ſuccour them, miniſtring to their neceſsities, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their profugates, and intertaining them into our
<pb facs="tcp:185203:6"/> boſomes, when they fly from their owne to us. Many of ours found among them a ſhelter from the ſtorme in our <hi>Marian daies,</hi> and doe ſtill, no doubt, bleſſe God for our peace, notwithſtanding their owne warres.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of our ſelves, there be many inſtructions which we may learne from the <hi>Lecture</hi> of their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. No privileges can finally ſecure a ſinfull people; for what have wee to glory in that they had not? The ſeedes of all their evills are ſowne in our fields. There be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe divers duties that wee ſhould abound in the more: In repentance, leſt we bring upon our ſelves the like: In prayer, that God would bleſſe our ſtate and government, that by the wiſdome thereof we may be led along in ſuch waies as may propagate our peace unto poſterity: In pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under thoſe chaſtiſments which we ſuffer. Though the hand of God hath long beene upon many Cities and Townes, and <hi>his Arme be ſtretched out ſtill</hi> upon ſome of them, yet is our miſery, happineſſe, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of theirs: If a gentle plague alone have affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us all, What would Sword and Famine with it doe?</p>
            <p>There be alſo ſome ſinnes in ſpeciall which wee ought to repent of; as drunkenneſſe, prophanation of the <hi>Lords Day, and other holy feſtivalls,</hi> raſh oathes, quickely made, and as quickly broken, together with Sacriledge, all which are moſt notorious, not among them alone, but among our ſelves alſo.</p>
            <p>This we ſhould doe, but what doe wee? <hi>Wee put farre away the evill day, and cauſe the ſeat of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:185203:7"/> to come neere: We drinke wine in bowles, and anoint our ſelves with the chiefe ointments, but are not grieved for the afflictions of</hi> Ioſeph, Amos <hi>6.3.</hi> &amp; <hi>6.</hi> This is no ſmall ſinne, and if once the day of our viſitation come, a ſmall chaſtiſement on Gods part will not be all. Oh that wee would conſider, <hi>the Vialls of Gods wrath are pouring forth, as well on his owne Churches for correction, as on their adverſaries unto deſtruction.</hi> Who knows how faſt the day may paſſe round? Gods arrowes are all fleet. <hi>The curſe of God goeth forth over the face of the whole earth,</hi> Zacch. <hi>5.3.</hi> If the ſinnes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> be found in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the ſinnes of <hi>Samaria</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they ſhall all pledge each other: for God is no reſpecter of perſons. Are there no drunkards but in <hi>Germany?</hi> Or, doth God hate ſinne in them alone? What are we, that God ſhould alwaies ſpare us? Many cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> and I with the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſay <hi>Amen. The Lord doe ſo, the Lord performe the words of them which propheſie of nothing but good,</hi> Ier. <hi>28.6.</hi> But its good to remember that of the Apoſtle, when they cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gloſſ. ordin.</hi> in Ier. <hi>7.12. Quicquid illi populo fecit Deus, timeamus: cum nos ſimilia facia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Yet no ſuch clouds <hi>(bleſſed be God)</hi> ariſe over our heads, as thoſe wherewith her horizon is darkened. But ſtormes ariſe ſuddenly. <hi>God creates good and evill,</hi> brings both when there is no appearance or cauſe of ſuſpicion. Not to feare, is cauſe enough to be affraid, if wee could ſo reflect upon our ſelves: <hi>As God brings
<pb facs="tcp:185203:7"/> light out of darkneſſe, ſo darkneſſe out of light.</hi> How faire roſe the Sunne upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> that day it rained fire and brimſtone? How poore a thing was a cloud like a mans hand, to prognoſticate abundance of raine by? But I muſt <hi>manum de tabula.</hi> Well then, reade on, reade and ſpare not, reade and conſider, reade and weepe, imagine the Booke to be <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelfe, their caſe ours, and <hi>our ſoules in their ſoules ſtead.</hi> Do as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, when he heard of the ſtate of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the Temple therein. <hi>He ſate downe and wept, mourned and faſted certaine daies, and prayed before the Lord God of Heaven,</hi> Neh. <hi>1.4.</hi> Would we but doe the like for our ſelves and them, God would aſſuredly reſtore their peace, and continue ours, for which I ſhall ever heartily pray, and ſo reſt</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Vills of Puniſhment are Gods, the evill of Sinne is wholly ours. Whatſoever was the impulſive cauſe of his iudgements, our whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt uſe is, to attribute them to our ſins: to greater ſins, greater Iudgements, ſeeing God ſeemeth to obſerve a proportion to our deſerts: for, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21. the Prophet ſpeaks of foure ſore Iudgements, that is, greater and more grievous than the reſt: famine, ſword, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, and the noyſome beaſt. With theſe hath he lately viſited ſome nations; eſpecially <hi>Germany,</hi> before a large, populous, fertile and flouriſhing Countrey. What ſhall we ſay? were their ſinnes greater than ours? No, but except we repent, what may we expect? the ſinnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> were pride, idleneſſe, and fulneſſe of bread; and ſuch they acknowledge theirs to have beene. I have ſeene their peaſants ſerved in plate, they ſlept
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:185203:9"/> with downe-beds above and under them: their ſtoves kept them inſenſible of the winters cold; they ate no diſh of meate without his ſauce; their plenty of corne and wine, milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, fiſh and fleſh, did equall that of any other nation whatſoever. A little labour brought them in much; delicacy of living, made them incompaſſionate of others ſufferings; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity blinded them, that they could not ſee the ſtorme a comming. Thus, while they ſwim in fulneſſe and pleaſure, the Iudgement that ſlept, was ſuddenly awaked, and the fire of war was kindled in all their coaſts; which blowne with the bellowes of exaſperated ſpirits, hath depopulated their Land, and conſumed their dwellings to the ground: all lieth deſolate; the vineyards are not dreſſed, nor the fields tilled: the ſword is every where drunke with blood. Famine killeth more than the ſword; and the peſtilence, with other Epidemicke diſeaſes (warres attendants) devoure their part alſo; and, which is worſt of all, there is yet no end of theſe things.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Extortions and exactions.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O beginne with warre, which beganne the reſt, who knoweth not that this mercileſſe fury hath there plaied the tyrant ever ſince that burning Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, the blazing ſtarre, gave them the alarme, 1617. which the beſt Aſtrologers expounded the ſword of <hi>Germany.</hi> A prophecie I have ſeene, long ſince, written in a Booke, which belonged to a canonick of <hi>Nimegon,</hi> and now in the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Zutphen;</hi> that a time ſhould come, when one <hi>Frederike</hi> ſhould be King, and then ſhould the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Nobility of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the people of both be oppreſſed, and warre rage, beyond all precedent of former ages; this, if ever, is now fulfilled in our daies. And if in ſuch diſorder, it may be poſſible, I will obſerve this order in ſpeaking thereof: firſt, extortions and exactions: ſecondly, tortures and torments: thirdly, rape and raviſhing: fourthly, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and pillaging: fifthly, blood-ſhed and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: ſixthly, burning and deſtroying. Theſe ſhall be the ſcenes of this firſt act. Famine and peſtilence ſhall ſtand for the other acts of this direfull tragedy: in which, as no action or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſimple, or ſingle, ſo can I not but with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:185203:11"/> intermixtion, and confuſion rehearſe them.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, as no province or part of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> can boaſt of her freedome from theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries (though ſome have beene more free than others) ſo is there no Prince, nor State, which hath not ſuffered herein, no City, no Towne, almoſt no perſon. Every halfe yeeres, every moneths, yea, weekes relation, telleth us, of hundreds, thouſands, millions of rix dollars, or guldens, impoſed, exacted, extorted by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, or ſpoylers, for the redemption of mens lives or liberties, goods or dwellings, &amp;c. Strange and impoſſible oft-times have the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes beene, with which they have taxed the Burgers, at the taking in of townes.</p>
            <p>And that they might have their wills in this kinde, they have called the Magiſtrates, and Burghers into the State-houſes, threatned, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, or otherwiſe abuſed them, till they condeſcended.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Gryphenberg,</hi> they kept the Senators ſhut up in a chamber of the common hall, macerating, and tormenting them ſo long with hunger and ſmoake, that ſome of them dyed.</p>
            <p>Wee left in <hi>Heydelberg</hi> Caſtle many Burgers to this their mercy; and divers reverend Miniſters, who were impriſoned, and fed with bread and water, till the charity of the reformed Churches could relieve them.</p>
            <p>Preſently after, they at <hi>Frankendale</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:185203:11"/> the towne, upon neceſſity, could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the articles granted them by the enemy; But were together with the grave Counſellours, and other Electorall Miniſters, forced to endure ſuch conditions, as were fitter for ſlaves and dogges, than men. Some were caſt into priſon, and there ſo handled, that many of them dyed through griefe and ſorrow. Others, though altogether exhauſted, redeemed themſelves with unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ranſomes. The goods of thoſe that were fled, were confiſcated: all the inhabitants, though they were willing to leave their houſes, with all their furniture, were detained in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their deſtruction moſt cruelly plotted: after like manner have others beene dealt with, contrary to all oathes and promiſes, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray to the lawes of nations and common faith.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to inſiſt on theſe, looke we up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cruelties which the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Souldier hath exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſons of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, without reſpect of age, ſex, dignitie, calling, &amp;c. and we ſhall rather thinke them banditos or renegado's, than men of armes, rather monſters than mankinde. Nor Turkes nor Infidels have ſo behaved themſelves. Even Princes (ſacred perſons) though they never bore armes, as the old Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and others: yea ſome of the female ſex, as the old Dutcheſſe dowager of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> have beene without any regard or pitty, taken priſonors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, abuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aronibeus</hi> reporteth from the Letters of the D. of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that ſome of <hi>Tillies</hi> Souldiers cauſed his Subiects to be tortured, by halfe ſtrangling them, and preſſing their thumbes with wheeles.</p>
            <p>His Souldiers, and thoſe of <hi>Walsten,</hi> exerciſed yet greater cruelties in <hi>Pomeren,</hi> and thereabouts. They made the people by force to eate their owne excrements: and if they would not, they thruſt them downe their throats and ſo choaked ſome of them.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:185203:14"/>
            <p>Whom they thought to have hidden gold or other wealth, they have aſſyed, by exquiſite torments to make them confeſſe. Yea Princely perſonages have ſuffered like cruelty in this kinde with meaner folke.</p>
            <p>They have wound and tied about the heads of ſuch, ſtrong matches or cords, and twiſted the ſame till the blood came out of their eyes, eares, and noſes, yea till their eyes ſtarted out of their heads.</p>
            <p>They have put and tied burning Matches betwixt their fingers, to their noſes, tongues, iawes, cheekes, breaſts, legges, and ſecret parts.</p>
            <p>Yea thoſe parts which nature hideth, they have either filled with powder, or hung ſatchels of powder on them, and ſo giving fire to the ſame, they have in horrible manner burſt their bellies, and killed them.</p>
            <p>They have with bodkins pierced, yea with knives raced, and cut the skinne and fleſh of many, as ſome Artificers deale with Leather, or other ſtuffe of like nature.</p>
            <p>They have drawne ſtrings and cords thorow the fleſhy parts of ſome, the muſcles of their thighes, legges, armes, &amp;c. through their noſes, eares, lips, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They have hung up ſome in the ſmoake, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſmall fires, refreſhing them ſometime with ſmall drinke, or cold water. For theſe being ſuch as were before overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:185203:14"/> with griefe, they tooke care leaſt in their torment they ſhould die too ſoone.</p>
            <p>Some they have put into hot Ovens and ſo ſmothered or burned them. Some they roſted with ſtraw-fires.</p>
            <p>Some have they ſtifeled, ſtrangled or han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. This was great favour to be ridde out of their paine.</p>
            <p>To many they have bound ſo hard both hands and feete, that the blood hath ſprouted out at the ends of their fingers and toes.</p>
            <p>Of ſome they have tied both hands and feete backward together, and ſtopped their mouthes with clouts to hinder them from praying.</p>
            <p>Some have they hanged up, with ropes faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their privie parts, and hearing their roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cries, have ſtriven to out-roare and drowne their cries as in ſport.</p>
            <p>And yet more deteſtable, where they have found poore weake Creatures troubled with ruptures or burſtneſſe, they have enlarged the ſame by villanous meanes, filled them with gun-powder, and blowne them up as a mine, by giving fire thereunto.</p>
            <p>Many have they truſſed up on high, hanging on their feete ſtones and weights to ſtretch our their bodies.</p>
            <p>With Jizels or like inſtruments they have gone about to plaine the faces of ſome, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they would make it equall &amp; ſmooth.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:185203:15"/>
            <p>Some houſholders have they openly gelded, in the preſence of their wives and children.</p>
            <p>The mouthes of ſome have they opened with gags, and then poured downe their throates, water, ſtinking puddle, filthy liquids, and piſſe it ſelfe, ſaying, this is a Swediſh draught. So grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſicke, and their bellies ſwelling like a tunne they have died by leiſure with the greater torment.</p>
            <p>Downe the throates of others, they have thruſt a knotted clout, &amp; then with a ſtring pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it up againe to move the bowels out of their place, or ſhew themſelves exquiſite in ſuch divelliſh devices. And by theſe torments they have made ſome deafe, or dumbe, others blind, others lame and miſerable creples, if they killed them not.</p>
            <p>If an husband did intreate for the wife, or the wife for the husband, then tooke they the interceſſour and he was tortured by them, after the ſame manner before the others eyes.</p>
            <p>And (which is almoſt beyond all credit) when theſe poore priſoners or patients, were ſuffering or dying under their hands, and crying to God in their anguiſh, theſe helliſh executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would command or force them to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the divell or call upon him.</p>
            <p>Infinite and unſpeakeable are the cruelties, which have this laſt yeere beene exerciſed by the furious Souldiers on all ſides.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:185203:15"/>
            <p>And ſome divels among them did proceed ſo farre, that they conſulted and deviſed new and exquiſite tortures, which they exerciſed upon innocent perſons. They tooke a Divine, (ſome write a Canon in thoſe parts, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend old man) ſtripped him, bound him along upon his backe on a Table, and a ſtrong bigge Cat upon his naked belly. They beate and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Cat to make her fixe her teeth and claws in the poore mans belly. So the Cat &amp; the man, partly through famine, partly through paine and anguiſh, both breathed their laſt.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſaid much of the former particular, and yet but little. I will now ſpeake little of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing abomination, and (I feare) too much. Rapes and raviſhing ſcarce to be ſpoken or heard of, have they committed, beyond all humane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. Maides, and matrons, widdowes and wives, without diſtinction have they violated and forced, and that in the preſence of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, husbands, neighbours, &amp;c. women with child, in child-bed, &amp;c. no penne can write it, no faith beleeve it. No Chappell, Church, or place conſecrated hath beene free from the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of pollutions or moſt ſacrilegious barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes. The very Hoſpitals and Bedlame-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have not beene ſpared: their divelliſh madneſſe hath there found ſubiects for their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Hoſſen</hi>-land, a poore leane bedlam wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that had beene kept in chaines above twenty yeeres, was by theſe hell-hounds let looſe. About her they brought divers others, like her ſelfe, ſome madde, ſome dumbe, all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:185203:18"/> wretched. They tied their coates about their cares, and ſo uſed them as I ſhame to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Pameren</hi> they tooke the faireſt daughters of the Countrey-dwellers, and raviſhed them in the light of their parents, making them and their friends to ſing Pſalmes before them all the while.</p>

But they ſound her out, had their pleaſures of her, then cut her in pieces, hung her quarters up in the Church, and bid her friends pray to the Saints for her ſuccour.</p>
            <p>The Sperenrenteriſh horſemen (as we came through <hi>Brunſwick</hi>-land) tooke by force a young maide ten yeeres old, and carried her into a wood to raviſh her. The mother with upreard hands came running after our Coach, crying out to my Colonell, who was here a ſtranger without command, and could not relieve her: then ſaw wee the two horſe-men come out of the wood, where they had left the poore childe dead or alive, I know not.</p>
            <p>Vertuous and chaſte women have they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to kill, or throwne their children into the fire, to make them yeeld.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:185203:18"/>

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of robbery and pillaging.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O man can now paſſe any where in <hi>Dutch</hi>-land, but he is robbed, ſtripped, perhaps killed. The Merchants of <hi>Frankford, Nurenberg, Lipzig Hamburg,</hi> &amp;c. have had too woefull experience hereof: witneſſe of infinite this one inſtance. The Merchants of <hi>Baſil,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the Mart at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and other Faires, to goe to <hi>Shoffehauſen,</hi> were ſet upon by the Imperialiſts in their lodging, and though they offered to prove themſelves Merchants, and craved their lives upon their knees, yet they killed ten of them, ſaying they muſt die, becauſe they were heretickes. The reſt leaving their goods and garments behind, eſcaped by flight ſtarke naked in the night.</p>
            <p>The very Convoyes which waite on thoſe that travell to guard them are oftentimes as bad, almoſt, as a ſtrange enemy. They watch all occaſions to take from them what they have, their money and goods, their horſes as they goe to watering, or out of the ſtables in the night, ſpoyle their wagons when they make a ſtand, rifle and ſtrippe and meaneſt perſons if they ſtraggle from the company, and ſo they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:185203:21"/> us all the way from <hi>Heydelberg</hi> to <hi>Heſſen</hi>-land: that wee knew not which was worſe our friend with us, or our enemy behinde us.</p>
            <p>Two Counteſſes of great nobility with their faire daughters and followers in diſtreſſe, were entertained by us in the Caſtle of <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> the one immediately before, the other in the time of the ſiege. When our hope of ſubſiſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faile, they went away with the enemies paſport. Notwithſtanding which they were by them robbed and rifled in their coaches of all they had, not ſparing the very garments that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them.</p>
            <p>The priviledged perſons of royall Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, their goods and followers cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from them, witneſſe this yeere the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plundering of the Daniſh Embaſſadour.</p>
            <p>What quarter they give to the traveller, the like or worſe they afford the inhabitants. If they eſcape with their lives this is all, and well too: when the time hath beene that one might have travelled ſafe from the one end of <hi>Germany</hi> to the other with a white rodde in his hand and an hundred pound in his purſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed they robbe one another every where out of their quarter: nor are they fellow ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers any longer, when they have opportunity to play the theeves. Nor God nor divell doe they acknowledge, but when they ſweare, nor is any thing ſo vile but they will doe it.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Bloodſhed and killing.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S for killing, this is the leaſt of all the reſt. Death puts an end to all miſeries; onely they that ſurvive are oft-times the worſe for want of them that are dead. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the blood-ſhed of this warre, would be incredible: <hi>Alſted</hi> ſaith, that before the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> comming, it had conſumed no leſſe than 100000 If this be true, what hath it done ſince? how many millions have miſerably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? they have ſometimes killed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and among other precedents, this is not leaſt remarkeable, that <hi>Gourdon</hi> and <hi>Leſley,</hi> Scotch Colonels, with Colonell <hi>Butler</hi> the Iriſh man, who killed <hi>Walſtein,</hi> the Count of <hi>Tirskie,</hi> and other Imperiall officers then readie to revolt to the Swediſh partie, are now, this yeere after the ſame manner, hurt or killed themſelves (as is written) by <hi>Gallas</hi> his followers, upon a diſpute about that former buſineſſe; a document for all ſtrangers to take heede, how they collogue with thoſe monſters, in ſuch dangerous actions, who love the treaſon, but hate the traitor.</p>
            <p>The crueltie of the Soulder towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of thoſe Countries is inexpreſſible.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:185203:23"/> Perſons ſecular and ſacred, have had the ſame meaſure. Neere <hi>Fryburg, Holck</hi> his Souldiers cut in pieces a reverend Miniſter, a man of rare learning and piety. The dogs would not licke his blood, nor touch his fleſh. So his friends bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his mangled members.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Landſhood</hi> in <hi>Bavier,</hi> the Souldier entring by force, killed not onely all they found in armes, but the innocent inhabitants, yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſts kneeling at the Altars; and divers other inſtances of like nature I could produce.</p>
            <p>Now what may the poore peaſant and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-dwellers expect? to kill them if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or refuſe them any thing, is but ordinary in this warre: among the Imperialiſts is a baſe ſort of raſcally horſe-men which ſerve them, and are called Croats. The tenth part of them are not of that Countrey: for they are a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanie of all ſtrange nations, without God, without religion, and have onely the outſides of men, and ſcarce that too. They make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of murthering men or women, old or young, yea, the very innocent babes; and like the beaſts among whom they are bred, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eate them, when other food might be found: the poore people have by theſe beene every where knocked downe in the fields and waies, ſlaughtered, ſtabbed, tortured barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p>Their fellow ſouldiers are not much behind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:185203:23"/> them having ſome where left ſuch foot-ſteps of their cruelty, that there ſcarce remaine living, to relate the ſufferings of the dead. I have ſeene them beat out the braines of poore old decrepid women, as in ſport, and commit other outrages of like nature, which my brevity will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to relate.</p>
            <p>It is now grown ſo uſuall with the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſee one ſlaine before anothers face, that (as though there were no relation, no affection of neighborhood, kindred or friendſhip among them) none compaſſionateth, almoſt none cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, oh my father, or oh my brother.</p>
            <p>As for quarter (that is mercy, and the ſaving of the lives of the vanquiſhed, when they begge it on their knees) the vanquiſhers have been oft times inhumane. The Croats, till of late, never gave any quarter, but killed whatſoever enemy they had at their mercy. The like did the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins (the regiment of hell) receive pay of them of <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> to bring the noſe and eares of their enemies away to their Maſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilly,</hi> after the defeate of the Duke of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> at <hi>Heuxt</hi> on the Maine, drew out of that towne threeſcore poore Souldiers, and cauſed them all to be killed in the cold blood, before the gate, ſaying, that he ſacrificed them to Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> their maſter. I could weary my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with theſe examples. But I forbeare.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Amine commeth next in place, a thing ſo grievous, that <hi>David</hi> preferred the peſtilence in his choice. To ſee men ſlaine by the ſword, or die of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes, is not yet ſo grievous, as to ſee them die of famine, or kill to eate one another. In <hi>Samaria</hi> beſieged by <hi>Benhadad</hi> K. of <hi>Syria,</hi> the famine was ſo great that an Aſſes head was ſold for 80. pieces of ſilver, and the fourth part of a cab of Doves dung forfifty pieces of ſilver. Two women covenanted to eate their children ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively: and when they had boyled and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the one, the other woman hid hers. In the ſiege of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> mice, ratts, and hides were good meate, and women did dreſſe and eate their owne children, the ſmell whereof drew others that were hunger-ſtarved to come to ſhare with them. But that Cities not beſieged, and a Countrey naturally fertile ſhould bee ſo ruined as not to bee able, for ſo long a time to afford bread to a poore remnant of people, but that they muſt be faine to eate carian, yea dead men, yea one another living: this is pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, this is unheard of.</p>
            <p>Had I not beene provided of <hi>Viaticum,</hi> at my
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:185203:28"/> comming out of <hi>Suiſſe</hi> famine had arreſted mee in <hi>Germany,</hi> for there was not any where meate for money. The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which had been at the ſkirmiſh at <hi>Nortlingen,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out armes, wandred among the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raines</hi> troupes at <hi>Nyburg</hi> and <hi>Briſac,</hi> were ſo black and feeble through hunger, that had I not given them part of my proviſion, I thinke they had rent mee in pieces and eaten mee.</p>
            <p>Travelling from <hi>Nieuſtadt</hi> toward <hi>Frankendale</hi> in a ſnowie day, I met, unexpected, the army of <hi>Duke Bernard,</hi> whoſe ſtragling fore-runners, came riding vp to me by couples, and when I looked for a worſe errand, aſked only for bread, which my guide gave them, ſo long as wee had any.</p>
            <p>From thence to <hi>Manheime</hi> and <hi>Heydleberg,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dead men lay ſtrewed on the way, eſpecially on the fire places, which periſhed through cold and want.</p>
            <p>Before wee were beſieged laſt time in <hi>Heydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> Caſtle, ſome of my patients, almoſt recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their diſeaſes, ſent mee word, they were dying of famine, as indeed they did, except our canon helped to ſhorten their miſeries. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately ſhut up, we ſhot into the towne night and day, almoſt unceſſantly.</p>
            <p>Our ſouldiers at the firſt, killed more horſes on a day, than they could eate, leſt they ſhould famiſh for want of hay, and thoſe they threw out of the Caſtle, downe the rocke, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:185203:28"/> the enemy in the night drew into the towne, (though ſome in ſo doing were ſlaine by our ſhot) and ſo they ate our horſe fleſh, alſo our Serieant Maior ſallied with fifty men upon the enemy being 300. entrenched on the hill on the Eaſt ſide of the Caſtle, and beate them out of their workes. Many were ſlaine, ſome broke their necks downe the rocks: but which equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized the victory, the valiant Maior was ſhot dead. Our ſouldiers being maſters of the trench, fell to ranſacke the enemies knapſackes which they had left behind them. But there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, ſave our horſe fleſh, which every day grew ſcarſer with us: ſo that now we kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the horſes which ſtood faſting and ſleeping on the dung-hill, not out of compaſſion, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Another Serieant Maior had two very faire horſes ſhut up, our ſouldiers tooke the one and ate him, hee thinking to make ſure the other, ſtapled him to the wall with a ſtrong chain and a padlock, but they eſpying their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, cut off the horſes necke, left the head in the chaine, and carried away the body and ate it.</p>
            <p>At length, dogs and carian came into requeſt, wee could ſmell our meat afarre off, and on the table it was yet more loathſome, the taſte did anſwer the ſmell, yet, we ate it ſavourly, but our bread at laſt failing, we yeelded to neceſſity.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Famine.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He armies now every where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ranne the Countrey, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured both Corne and Cattell: ſo they that had goods left offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to give all for a little belly-timber. But not ſo obtaining it they were faine to lie upon the ſtreets and high waies, (a thing not uſuall with them) and to crave for Gods ſake wherewith to refreſh their dying ſoules. But no ſooner had they ſwallowed what was given them, but they fell downe and died.</p>
            <p>Memorable is that ſtory which <hi>Reinmannus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth of the Famine in <hi>Alſatia</hi> the laſt yeere, which is at this preſent yet worſe. <hi>Valentine</hi> of <hi>Engelin</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rufack,</hi> with the dead-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, delivered unto the Magiſtrate upon their oathes, that <hi>Anne</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iohn Ehſtein</hi> confeſſed unto them, that ſhe came from <hi>Colmar,</hi> where ſhee had waited many daies before the hangmans doore in hope to get a piece of horſ-fleſh to ſatisfie her hunger. But not prevailing, ſhe was now come to <hi>Rufack</hi> entreating them, that if there was the body of any young man or woman unburied, that they would give it her to eate to preſerve her life.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:185203:31"/>
            <p>And that two women &amp; a boy did after the ſame manner ſpeake unto them, telling them that they had for a long time lived of dead mens fleſh, which being publiſhed the Cloyſter of the Church-yard of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Nicholas</hi> where the dead bodies were kept was locked up.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that foure young maides had cut in pieces the dead bodies of another young maide of eleven yeeres of age, and eaten every one their part.</p>
            <p>At this day it is yet worſe. Many that ſurvived the loſſe of all they had, have for a long time ſuſtained themſelves with rootes, Acornes, greene fruites, graſſe, thiſtles, and weeds, that beaſts would not have eaten, whereof they grew enraged and died.</p>
            <p>The famiſhed have beene ſo faint, that they have not had ſtrength to bury one another, in ſo much, that the dead have beene eaten up of Dogges, Foxes and Wolves, and ſome have run madd for hunger.</p>
            <p>In ſome cities, the inhabitants by this famine, have beene conſtrained to kill all unedible cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, without any difference, and to ſell them publikely: as Dogs, Cats, Rats, Mice, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A woman at <hi>Hanaw,</hi> that had ſold dogs-fleſh ordinarily to the ſouldiers, was in the ſtreetes aſſaulted by Dogs, all her garments torne off her backe, that ſhee was faine to ſit downe on the ground to hide her ſhame. And, had ſhee not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:185203:31"/> beene reſcued, ſhee had beene rent in pieces by the Dogs.</p>
            <p>Where any man had a beaſt left that hee carefully kept for his neceſſity, ſome or other of his acquaintance, if hee could come by it, would kill and eate it.</p>
            <p>They have ſnatched one from another the very ſtinking carrion, which had lyen ſixe or ſeaven weakes dead and full of magots: yea and have fought and beaten one another to get a morſell thereof, as lately happened at <hi>Dubach</hi> by <hi>Bachrack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath moved the great ones and governours of theſe quarters unto compaſſion to ſee their people in ſuch extreame want. In ſo much that the noble Earle of <hi>Falkenſtein</hi> ſeeing his ſubiects crave ſuſtenance of him, commanded his man to give them his hounds to ſatisfie their hunger which they preſently killed and ate.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of Famine.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the ſickneſſe ſpreadeth by the contagion of infected bodies, ſo hath this famine encreaſed by the neglect of Providence in the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and famiſhed. When no more food was to bee got, they were inraged like beaſts one againſt another, and gathering together by troopes, have watched for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the high waies, and ſo murthered, dreſſed and eaten one another. Thenceforth no man could paſſe ſafe on the way or in the ſtreets, except well armed or travelling with a convoy. And ſome of them have beene taken and ſeverely puniſhed by Juſtice, nevertheleſſe they have ſecretly lurked here and there, and ſet upon the paſſengers, as by many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I could ſhew.</p>
            <p>It is not good to be alone; for where there is companie, the one will helpe the other in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. The hardneſſe of theſe times being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or rather felt, three maidens at <hi>Odenheim</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:185203:34"/> in <hi>Dirmbſtein</hi> by <hi>Wormes</hi> agreed to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to partake of ſweet and ſower all alike. But the proverbe is true, that neceſſity hath no law, and hunger is a ſharpe thorne. So preſſed they were with extreame famine, that they ſought one anothers lives to ſave their owne. Two of them conſpired together to take away the life of the third, by ſtrangling her in bed or otherwiſe treacherouſly to kill her, and after to dreſſe and eate her up. All which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Then the ſecond reſolved to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her companion, and cut off her head, which when ſhe had done, her heart being hardened, ſhe went to a village called <hi>Ridiſheim</hi> to a woman of her acquaintance, called <hi>Margaret,</hi> whoſe husband was a Farmer, and kept himſelfe away for a time in the towne of <hi>Leyningen.</hi> The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entertained her kindly, reioycing that ſhee came yet once to ſee her. But in the night, lying by the ſaid woman, ſhe cut off her head, bound the dead body upon a board and brought it to <hi>Piedeſſen,</hi> where ſhe dwelt and drew it into her houſe. The ſharpeneſſe of hunger pricking her, ſhe had not the patience to cut the body in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but did cut off the head and both the hands onely, and waſhed and dreſſed them. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band comming home miſſed his wife, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for her at the neighbours, who told him that ſuch a maide was ſeene with his wife. Hee went to her houſe, knocked at the doore and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:185203:34"/> her, if ſhe had not ſeene his wife. She anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him no. But ſuch deedes of cruelty are hardr to bee concealed. Murther will out, they ſay, or the very bruits will diſcover it. He goes into he houſe, caſteth his eyes round about, pryeth into every corner: At length hee eſpieth an hand to ſticke out of the pot, which hung upon the fire. Hereupon, as overcome with griefe hee rageth and rayleth againſt the murdereſſe, threatneth her with ſharpe words, ſo that ſhe preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and revealed it.</p>
            <p>Then went he to the Juſtice and complained. So ſhee was brought to <hi>Slitzey</hi> with three Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers. They made her hold the ſodden hand in her hand, while ſhee was examined: and ſo ſhe had her ſentence from the imperiall officers, <hi>Burgrave Philip</hi> of <hi>Waldecke,</hi> and all the Lords of Juſtice, before the iudgement ſeat. They deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated long about her puniſhment, whether ſhe ſhould die or no, becauſe ſome were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſhee did it not as a rationall creature but as a brute, becauſe the appetite of food is common to us with beaſtes. But wickedneſſe, though neceſſitated, may not ever goe free. Some muſt be made an example for the terrour of others. She was led to the common place of iuſtice, her head cut off, and her body bound upon a wheele there to remaine as a ſpectacle.</p>

            <p>No man ever hated his owne fleſh. But ſuch are the children of our bodies. It is even againſt nature to deſtroy ſuch fruite. Yet the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hunger brought this to paſſe. Oh! what is that neceſſity which makes us breake ſtone walls, forget the neereſt and deareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, vanquiſh our naturall and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſions and deſtroy that which wee ſo dearely loved, ſo carefully cheriſhed! At <hi>Oter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> in the Palatinate, a widow woman dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the churchyard (her name well known) had a daughter of nine or tenne yeares old. This childe with hunger was growne ſo faint, that upon a time, with ſorrowfull eyes, ſhee ſtedfaſtly looked upon her mother and ſaid, ſweet mother, I would willingly dye, ſo I were rid of my paine. Oh! would you make an end of me, then ſhould I goe from whence I came, or if I did kill you, you would bee rid of your paine. The mother looking upon her againe, ſighing ſaid, and what wouldeſt thou doe with me? The childe anſwered, very ſadly, I then would eate you, for they ſay that mans fleſh is very ſweet. The mother fell a weeping, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:185203:35"/> broken with her owne thoughts, as a ſhip toſſed and beaten betweene two rocks, deſperate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity &amp; her motherly affection, catcheth at her head, untyeth her haire-lace, twiſteth it about the necke of this innocent lambe, and ſo ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her, when it was dead, ſhe having nor knife nor hatchet to cut it in pieces, tooke a ſpade, and therewith hewed it into gobbets, and ſo dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the head and part of the body devoured it. Some part thereof ſhee ſould to her neighbours for foure ſtivers the pound.</p>
            <p>Her childe being long miſſed, her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance asked her where it was, and how ſhe came by that fleſh. She anſwered it was hogs-fleſh, which ſhe had got of the ſouldiers, who paſſed that way. But perceiving the truth would come out, ſhe at laſt confeſſed it. Whereupon ſhe was complained of to the iuſtice at <hi>Keyſars Lauteren,</hi> and put in priſon by <hi>Ionker van Effren,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to an halfe pound of bread, and a kanne of water a day, ſo to expect her ſentence. But being ſent for out of priſon and examined by the lords ſhee told them ſhe was happy, that ſhe was in priſon, and would be glad to lie there all her life, to ſlake her hunger and refreſh her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with ſuch food, her pricking paine being thereby abated. This ſo moved the Lords to pitty, that they freed her from priſon, and let her goe as innocent.</p>
            <p>I cannot but record another ſtory of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:185203:36"/> of the woman of <hi>Hornebach,</hi> where was ſometime the Princely ſchoole of <hi>Zwybruck,</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lately lyen in childbed and wanting milke to nouriſh her babe, ſhe kiſſed and embraced it with moyſt teares, and after a long diſcourſe killed it with a knife. Afterwards ſhee dreſſed and ate it. When it began to be knowne, ſhee was examined before the iuſtices. The Lords aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her, wherefore ſhee killed her childe. She made anſwer that mighty and intollerable hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had made her ſo to doe, and that it was her owne fruite, of which ſhee might better make uſe, then of any other. Nevertheleſſe ſhe was condemned to dye, and accordingly executed.</p>

Adde hereunto that for theſe wee ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome know any ſpecificall remedy, for the peſtilence I am ſure there is none, as being Gods immediate judgement, though oft times hee uſeth the miniſtery of ſecondary cauſes, for the executing of his further pleaſure herein, I have made tryall of all ſorts of antidotes vegetable, minerall, animall, and that according to rationall method, yet am I almoſt as farre from the cure, as ever.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:185203:40"/> to ſtay long in a place, and not to leave ſome infection behind. Beyond the Dona, after the Swedens departure from thence with their Armies, diſeaſes unheard of, and the peſt withall ſwept away a world of people. The like happened ſhortly after, about <hi>Nurrenberg</hi> in the high Palatinate, and on the frontiers of <hi>Boheme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before Maſtreicht, after the Towne was taken, our quarters had contracted infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſickneſſes: whereof I my ſelfe had my ſhare, being left ſicke in the Towne of a purple Feaver. But the yeere following both the Towne and Countrie were grievouſly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, with Feavers, Fluxes, and the Plague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all.</p>
            <p>The ſame yeare <hi>Elſas</hi> or <hi>Alſatia</hi> and the lower Palatinate, where the Armies of the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> and the Rhinegrave had lodged, did ſuffer miſerably in this kinde.</p>
            <p>The Army of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> and marching toward <hi>Maſtricke</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> left ſuch infection in great <hi>Brabant,</hi> about <hi>Firkens</hi>-ward, that the inhabitants the yeare after were afraide of their owne dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, Generall <hi>Holck</hi> being ſent by <hi>Wolſtein,</hi> with 6000 to invade <hi>Saxony,</hi> ſacked the City of <hi>Leipzick</hi> and committed as great outrages as <hi>Tillies</hi> Army had done before.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:185203:40"/> But ſuch a peſtilence overtooke both him and his, that moſt of his Souldiers died like ſheepe of the rot. And being infected himſelfe, hee offered 600 Rixdollers for a Miniſter of the Goſpell to inſtruct and comfort him. But both himſelfe, and his Souldiers had ſo behaved themſelves, that no Miniſter was to be found. In the meane all his friends &amp; ſervants forſooke him, except his Concubine, who ſtayed with him to the laſt. He had beene both of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Proteſtants party, but revolted from both. So guilty of his owne perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the execrable murders and rapines that he had cauſed, he died deſpairing utterly of all future bliſſe. At length came a Miniſter, but <hi>Holck</hi> was dead before.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Baſile</hi> that winter, loſt above 20000. of the plague. They of the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> their neighbours rejoyced at their ſufferings, as being their enemies in religion. But it fell out with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as with <hi>Edom</hi> in <hi>Obadiah, v.</hi> 15. that moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Iacob</hi> in his diſtreſſe. The Winter following, 1634. the peſtilence ſo raged among the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentines, that we were forbidden to come that way, for the ſicke and ſound were mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that City (not great) buried above 30000.</p>
            <p>Beſieged in the Caſtle of <hi>Heidleberg</hi> I viſited every day, divers ſicke of the Plague, and like diſeaſes. But in neither of theſe two great
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:185203:41"/> plagues in <hi>London,</hi> nor in any other, that I have beene in did I ever finde the cauſe ſo virulent, the ſymptomes ſo incorrigible, the diſeaſe ſo incurable. Some died raging, others were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their carbuncles, when the venome ſeemed to bee expelled from the inward parts, others were ſwollen and diſcoloured, as though they had taken poyſon, and ſome that died were ſo ſpotted, as I never ſaw the like. If any ſouldier were but ſleightly wounded, preſently it became a maligne ulcer, though all good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward meanes were uſed. If the infection got into a kindred, it killed parents, children, and almoſt all the blood, that were preſent. Whence I perſwade my ſelfe that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, the divine hand and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God was more conſpicuous in this, than in any other viſitation I had ſeene, though I doubt not but our foode with the aire might alſo helpe to empoyſon our bodies extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily.</p>
            <p>Toward the end of the ſiege wee had made an hoſpitall in the roofe of the houſe. But packing out of the Caſtle, wee left there our ſicke ſome dying, ſome crying out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes not to be left to their ſickneſſe, famine, and death, and which was worſe than the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of whom how they were uſed wee may imagine:</p>
            <p>In the Towne they were much viſited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:185203:41"/> we were ſhut up: which could not but be augmented by the multitudes of the enemie.</p>
            <p>In the ſiege of <hi>Hanaw</hi> were buried (moſt of the plague) above 22000 people, and had not God ſent that ſickneſſe to diminiſh their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they had yeelded the towne through want of victuals.</p>
            <p>In the ſame ſiege, Souldiers that went to the guard ſeeing and well, came off ſtrucken ſtarke blind thirty at a time. Afterwards the diſeaſe falling into their legges, the moſt of them reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of ſickneſſe and diſeaſes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He yeare 1635 almoſt whole <hi>Germany</hi> felt this puniſhment, in moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wiſe. In <hi>Swaben</hi> the Countrey of <hi>Tyroll,</hi> all along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the Maine, it was ſo furiouſly hot, that all places were alike ſafe. The King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> was faine to diſſolve his Court and ſend them away into divers Cities, for their ſafer abode.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Swaben</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Memingen, Campden,</hi> and <hi>Iſuen</hi> were utterly conſumed, and none left. In the Countrey thereabout, in which were more than thirty thouſand men heretofore, were not foure hundred ſoules to be found.</p>
            <p>In the confines of <hi>Bavier</hi> the living were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neere able to bury the dead. But Rats and Mice devoured their carcaſſes, moſt horrible to behold.</p>
            <p>The low Countries ſmarted ſore alſo. The Univerſity of <hi>Leyden</hi> buried thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. The Countrey Villages and the Hague,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:185203:44"/> (where I was ſhut up my ſelfe) were miſerably afflicted. The Infant Cardinall was forced to remove from <hi>Bruxels</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the ſickneſſe did ſo encreaſe, in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nimegen, Emerike, Rees, Guelders,</hi> with other places neere, were not onely viſited therewith (whereof the Marqueſſe of <hi>Aytona,</hi> the Spaniſh Generall, and other Commanders died) but new contagious diſeaſes, among which were ſtrange Fluxes, and a kinde of pox unheard of.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Army diſperſing all over for want of reſiſtance, did alſo ſcatter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion from their quarters at <hi>Haylbrun,</hi> through the Land of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> that many places here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became utterly depopulated. But ſince <hi>Gallas</hi> his taking in the Townes upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſuch an infection happened through the ſtinch of the dead unburied bodies, that in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Meniz</hi> alone there died of this and hunger twenty foure thouſand people.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Saxony, Brandenburg, Pomeren, Mecklenburg,</hi> &amp;c. this yeare the peſtilence with like diſeaſes have beene ſo univerſall, that theſe and the ſword, ſeeme to ſtrive which ſhall be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt deſtroyer. The retraite of the Swedes, in which they did not onely evade, but cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces many of the enemies troopes, is not ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as theſe calamities. The very plague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in <hi>Saxony</hi> the other day in the ſpace of two moneths, no leſſe than ſixteene thouſand
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:185203:44"/> ſoules. Inſomuch that the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> hath given command, that none ſhall come from thence to <hi>Prague,</hi> or the Cities of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As by the print of <hi>Hercules</hi> his foot you might gueſſe at his ſtature, ſo by theſe few particulars of the miſeries of ſome places there wee may gueſſe at the lamentable eſtate of the whole. The warre having every where caught and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hath left ſuch wounds as will not in haſte be recured, and perhaps poſterity for ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations will ſee the skars.</p>
            <p>Thus is the Virgine daughter of that people deſtroyed with a great deſtruction, and with a ſore and grievous plague. Goe into the field,<note place="margin">Ier. 14.17.</note> behold the ſlaine with the ſword. Enter into the City, behold them that are ſicke for hunger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. So are they ſmitten, but are not healed. They looke for peace, but there is no good; for the time of health, but behold trouble.</p>
